## Survival Task

```
As for the task required to run I have decided for a simple game of tag. I was intriguied
by the simplicity of that game, but as well how tricky it can get depending on the players
audacity.
```

## What is being applied?

```
Using genomes the behavior of the subjects will be determined through their genes.
The genes will be determined at the beginning through a randomizer. From there on
the seekers who caught their target get to survive, while does who did not die in
the spot. As for the opposing subjects will apply the same principle but prevent
from getting caught.
```
